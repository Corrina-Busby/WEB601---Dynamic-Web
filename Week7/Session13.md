# Week 7 Session 13

### Thunder Talks and Open Source Contributions

Today was fun and very relaxing considering we have presentations looming over our heads.
Class is held in the Kowhai lounge which <br>is nice n comfy for a change. We kick off with github contributions to open source projects. Takes me an hour to figure out what we are<br> doing to clone and then decide what to write. Initially thought we were fixing other people code to which I would be more likely to make<br> more errors - but it was not like that, Ali's teaching was in becoming familliar and building confidence in contributing to open source projects.<br> All that was expected was a compliment or a hello nothing major just some practice to get us on the github bandwagon and our fear of <br>contributing on others github repositories.

I thought I would comment on a friends open source project - but when i went to push the commit I received an error and spent a bit of time<br> trying to fix it. My friend sent me a message later that evening with a snap shot of the request I had made to his repo, so in the end I guess<br> it all went through, success.

The presentations were great - every talk was different, informative and well presented.
