# Week 7 Session 12

### What, why, how ###

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, need to think about each piece in isolation. 
Components 
A class component is the most simple form of a smart or stateless component

Use a class component to:
* add logic to an event handler
* need to manage a local state
* need to add lifecycle methods to your component

Otherwise always use a functional component
Class components that only have markup within the render body can with no problems be converted to a functional component.

### Props
Props make components in React easily a dynamically customizable. By passing data/properties down from one component the parent to another typically the child. 
Props:
* are read only
* a component must never modify the props passed to it
* when a component is passed props as input it should always return the same result for the same input

React componentâ€™s lifecyle methods can be split in four phases: 
 * initialization -  
 * mounting - 
 * updating - 
 * unmounting -
