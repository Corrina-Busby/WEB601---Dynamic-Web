# Week 7 Session 12

### What, why, how ###

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, need to think about each piece in isolation. 
Components 
A class component is the most simple form of a smart or stateless component

Use a class component to:
* add logic to an event handler
* need to manage a local state
* need to add lifecycle methods to your component

Otherwise always use a functional component
Class components that only have markup within the render body can with no problems be converted to a functional component.

### Props
Props make components in React easily a dynamically customizable. By passing data/properties down from one component the parent to another typically the child. 
Props:
* are read only
* a component must never modify the props passed to it
* when a component is passed props as input it should always return the same result for the same input

React componentâ€™s lifecyle methods can be split in four phases: 
 * initialization -  
 * mounting - 
 * updating - 
 * unmounting -

Nothing happening here, I am unsure where to start and plan to dedicate some time to the website once I have my Networking practical and report out of the way.
Other than that Jason, Callum and I arranged a meeting to discuss our presentation.
Stack Thunder talk on Friday Jason, Callum and I have put together the M.A.N.K stack MySql, Angular, Node.js and Knex we put together a stack that we would use at this time for our own projects. I will be covering Node.js and abit on NPM - Callum has been left with Angular, Jason Knex and Mysql is up for grabs.

class vs function - need to revisit this section 
stateful and stateless - as well as this section 

Slowly chipping my way through the Basic JavaScript in freeCodeCamp. It still remains I have many tutorials to grind through in codecademy.
Milestone 2 is due in under a week which is kind of scary assuming I have not even started. Spent the day working through some notes for our presentation this Friday. Im not totally sure where this idea of throwing in a presentation at this time was very nice, was wanting to open up my vscode to get the feel for my website again due to spending some weeks away from it. I guess next week.
