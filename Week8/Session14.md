# Week 8 Session 14

### I missed class!! 

Think I ate some bad takeaways ugh ;( 
    <br>
    <br>
Todays session was installing **Webpack** and **babel**. To my knowledge Webpack is used to bundle our code when we are writing modular code<br>
 not all of our JavaScript is placed in one file. We need to make sure our code is working together when it is running.
So we will use Webpack <br>
to bundle our assets like JavaScript and CSS into a single file. Webpack is also a compiler for SaaS codes.
<br>
<br>
ES06 is considered a relatively new code prior to ES06 it was ES05, because not all browser yet suppport ES06, we will load the Babel transpiler<br> plugin into Webpack. This will help render our ES06 code readable.
<br>
<br>
It would appear that many had difficulty installing babel therefore I am expecting the same issues.
