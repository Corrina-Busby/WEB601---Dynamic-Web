# Week 8 Session 15

## Its a blurr..... I should've taken notes!

### Postman - Mysql 

**PostMan** is a tool we installed that is used for inspecting input and output from web servers. Our plan is to<br>
 use this for testing **API requests** and making sure that what we get back is what is expected. So far what I<br>
  see when I open PostMan is a nice simple friendly GuI the obstacle is finding out how PostMan is utilized. 
<br>
<br>

PostMan offer an add-on package called **Jetpacks** that I want to investigate but there is no time right<br> 
now to look into this because we have moved on to installing **MySql workbench** and **MySql Installer**<br> 
and to be honest I am not sure if I have installed the correct Sql applications now that I am writing this <br>
blog. Not to worry what I currently have did not stop me from executing mySql statements. 
<br>
<br>

 Ali took us through a quick exercise of joining tables - In actual fact have been in this environment briefly<br>
  3 months a go for my DATABASE paper, but you wouldn't blimen think so. I ended up grabbing a cheat sheet <br>
  offline and shoulder surfing my neighbours work - a another class mate introduced me to a data generator ugh.
 <br>
 <br> 
 What a rushed refresher lol
 <br>
 <br>

 ### My Web Project
Finally opened up my web project after about a month ugh and it was like starting over again.I had forgotten<br>
 quite a lot and started to renavigate around and get my bearings again.I ended up shutting it down thinking<br>
 I have too many JavaScripts tutorials and other software tools like mysql, postman and whatever else there<br>
  is to throw myself into revisiting the react environment right now and diving 3am deep into that when I <br>
  have this feeling I am going down the wrong path. 

 ### Homework
 To date just tackling the codecadmey and freecodecamp tutorials they take some thinking but doable.<br>
 Revisiting todays class if I can sort out my time schedule.
