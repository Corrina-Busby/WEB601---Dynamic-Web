# Session 3 Design Info

Today class was fun we formed "TeamMiddleDesk" a group of 6 and smashed together some 
wireframes for our Chip Comparer Android app basically comparing the prices of your 
fish n chips order from the fish n chips shops located near you.

It took a bit to get us somewhat on the same level of thinking and collaborating properly. 
We managed to conjure up 3 pages:

    * the landing page that you enter your postcode
    * the user then enters there food, clicks compare
    * list of fish n chips shops displayed with the price of the food the user input or selected
     in the previous scene.

There are a couple of features we are implementing but nothing to complex. It appears working 
with many contributors is proving a small challenge. For instance, it took us some time to get
or wireframes drafted up on the whiteboard due to getting all the people in our group's input 
on there contributions and thoughts.

All the same, class was fun and **communication** is key here.
