Our tutor is a wealth of information and has provided many resources for our learning experience. Currently, we are diving into HTML, CSS and JavaScript tutorials in **"codecademy"** some are quite lengthy but! very good and I am finding I am learning quite a lot. Some of the tutorials is a refresher from 2 years ago but I am 60% into a tutorial and the elements are now new to me.

I have yet to complete the last 8 tasks in **"learngitbranching"** as it is I have completed quite a lot of the material provided and still remain stuck on how to create a file in GitHub from vs code and git push or do I git pull or commit to the branch - I managed to do it twice and now I error out.

In todayâ€™s class, TeamMiddleDesk had to try and knuckle out how git workflows work many of us on different understandings on how we commit/merge/pull/push and who is working on what. It appears we are a tad individualistic when it comes to working so we spent a good part of today working on collaborating and delegating jobs.

We all just want to get on with the Chip Comparer app. frustratingly, being very fresh to GitHub is causing some issues. But! we shall get there.
