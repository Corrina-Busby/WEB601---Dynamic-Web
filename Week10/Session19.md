 # Week 10 Session 19
Web app and Styles 
For my learning, I have googled a few tutorials that use the following styles at times the tutorials are a bit dated or lengthy. Ali the tutor has us online doing tutorials to help us better understand

## CSS Colors ##
Wonderful colors are a pain in the behind, hours of time can e sucked up choosing the color and never being happy with it. CSS colors are many and easily implemented

## CSS Gradient ##
I have yet to play with gradients that show the transition between two or more colors. Currently unsure of my whole design at this time and how I want to have my website presented and the vibe I am aiming to create, however, the back end and the functionality is or was the last time I check has been the top priority for myself.

### CSS Flexbox ###
The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon screen size great for responsiveness. Flexbox is new to me just had a wee dabble with flexbox and its like magic how flexbox works and easily implemented. Flexbox is handy for laying out your design/ items in a single dimension for instance in a single row or column

### CSS selectors ###
If you want to specify that only one specific HTML element should be affected then you should use the element name with class selector.
for example:
<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
p.center {  
    text-align: center;  
    color: green;  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
<h1 className='center'>This heading is not affected</h1>  
<p className='center'>This paragraph is green and center-aligned.</p>   
</body>  
</html>  

## CSS Grid ##
So Grid appears to have the same effect as flexbox I am not quite sure the difference. Grid Layout gives us a method of creating grid structures that are described in CSS and not in HTML. I am not fully understanding all this at this time. It appears that Grid CSS is a web app responsive across many browsers and is recommended for implementing if you have a layout of items in two dimensions for example rows AnD columns. In that case, I have switched my courses application to Grid due to the potential of many courses being displayed on the page more than a row's worth.

## Homework
I have no shortage of research and tutorials to do for this paper. Many of the technologies are new to me, requiring many out of class hours to gain an understanding of my app environment.
