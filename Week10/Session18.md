Introduction to Redux 
What is Redux you ask? I really struggle to answer at this point of time. Does my website need this Redux? Redux sounds like a store that is shoved inbetween my website requests and the database. Having Redux maybe more efficient and not so heavy on the database if all the requests are made to the redux store. BUT! does my tiny project need this maybe not but we need to prove somehow that we can use Redux. 

Relationship between React and Redux 
I have no idea 

In class I learned that Redux is some kind of state container for JavaScript apps and helps with the STATE management of your application. Say for instance the management of the data displayed and the reaponse to user actions. Redux maintains the STATE of the entire application in one immutable state tree(object), which cannot be changed directly. When some does change a NEW object is created(using actions and reducers).

Following a tutorial that Tutor Ali have us start in class was not the easiest tutorial it was all backwards and come to the end the code source was all there and when running the source code it did not work. Ali gave us a copy of his repo of the same tutorial and when classmates popped it in to run it worked. 
Class finished with confusion but I had the react react tutorial to go home and work on. Jason a class collegue had found a Redux Tutorial that is more relatable and made more sense than the react-redux tutorial. With that link I will be heading home and spending some hours trying to understand Redux and how to implement it into my web application.

At this time I still walk away unsure what Redux can fully do for my web application or what is Redux other than it could quite well be a security measure on the state of your app. 

I have much to understand on Redux and how it will be introduced to my web project sounds interestingly complex

## freeCodeCamp - Redux
freeCodeCamp Redux tutorial has been advised for us to do.
