# Week 4 Session 7 The Push 

Today we went through the installation of npm, npm is a JavaScript development tool that Ali assures me will help me build a powerful application by implementing modern open source code via npm. It is used by over 11,000,000 JavaScript developer around the world. 

My attempt installing npm was a bit of a trip, I shouldve taken notes. I spent the afternoon with Milton, Daniel, Mark and Ali revising over the days lesson for better clarification. 

From my understanding **npm** is lots of things and hosts the following:

    *npm is the package manager for Node.js.an open       source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.

    *The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.

    *npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.

**The workload is building up there are many tutorials to work through that all take time.**

* CSS codecademy 
* JavaScript codecademy
* React codecademy

**Followed by:**

* wireframes
* storyboards
* blogs/journal
* the Report for milestone1
* some code 
* understanding how git flows 

ON that note I best get to it!!
