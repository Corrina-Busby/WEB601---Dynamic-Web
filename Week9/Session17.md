Project review
Today class was taken in the Kowhai lounge for a change which I believe we all enjoyed it was a lot better than sitting in the same boring class craning my neck to see the front.

Tutor Ali had us find or put together a full web stack and present it to our class. Callum, Jason and I decided on the M.A.N.K stack. We tried putting together a stack close enough to what we believe we will be implementing with our current project. MySQL, Angular, Node.js, and Knex.

We learned that Node.js helps with potential buffering - multiple requests can be sent and with some packages other than Node.js they process a request one at a time by doing this it may have wait time side effects. Whereas Node.js will start processing requests as soon as they are sent a request and if the 1st request is still processing when the 2nd request has finished the 2nd request will sit in the bus bay so to speak and as soon as the 1st request is finished the 2nd and so on will follow asynchronously.

Above all that I now know what a full-stack is a stack of technologies that have been put together for the development of your website.

Knowing what your stack is useful and something the team would benefit from knowing - As a team, we picked the M.A.N.K stack, besides Angular we thought it is good to gather an understanding of what technologies we will be using in WEB 602 project. 
We have a lot to understand and have barely scraped the surface of M.A.N.K in the few hours we had to gain sufficient knowledge on this stack.

Google and tutor Alis' resources and knowledge will be what we will be leaning on for the next few weeks. 

MySQL we are a little familiar with thanks to having used this in our DAT602 class. Mindful that it was a crash course and barely understood MySQL but it was nice to have opened up MySQL and not feel so lost at navigating my way around an environment we have touched on before.

The point of the presentations of a full-stack was to probably ensure that we do our research as it would be pretty embarrassing if you stood in front of the class saying nothing. I do think that there is so much more that I am in need to know there currently is not enough hours in the day to learn it all.

## freeCodeCamp - Insomnia
Still, plenty of tutorials to work through and learn a bit about Insomnia
