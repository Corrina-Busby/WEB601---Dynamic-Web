# Week 8 Session 15

## Well that was a trip!

### Postman - APIS

So today was a continuation from a section from Wednesdays class, I have walked in 7 minutes late which was a terrible rookie 
move and it would appear these guys are right in the middle of an exercise. I take a long hard look at the projector and figure
with the aid of my web buddy Jase sitting next to me, I can catchup just as long as I do not detract from his learning.

Doesnt take to long to be up with the others but i have missed the whole concept of the lesson I can see what we are doing 
and that is putting code together for our PostMan tool to be able to read our API requests, and the response is supposed to 
be what we expect and that at the moment the response should read 'Corrina has been added'.

What had me confused was not how quickly the lesson was executed, it was more how many ways we could do the one code method. Meaning tutor Ali started to show us one way how to perform something which is new and fine and not yet processed but then 
moved straight into how to do it another way and then another way and then it became to much tooooo much for this brain as this is how it carried on throughout the class.

I then lost what the point of the teaching was - I would have prefered to be shown one way and once i had understood what was 
happening then move on to another way of doing something or just have it be known that we may discover other ways to perform what we are trying to achieve but here's one way to do an api request. But of course we know theres always several ways to get an outcome or same response to something. I just first need to be abit more comfortable with the first step in order to comprehend what the purpose is before I can understand the rest of the lesson.

Otherwise I did end up with the appropiate response but with no idea what it all had to do with my web project. We didnt install it
in our web project so not really understanding what is going on at this time. I really need to make time and google a few hours of what the hell this was all about. So much or possibly not much happened I dont even know how I got to the end with the correct output.
