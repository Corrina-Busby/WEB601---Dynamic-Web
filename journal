Session 1 Course Overview

In class, Ali our new tutor briefly touched on his background and demystifying git/git hub. 
A year back in one of my SDV classes I signed up for a git account but due to not understanding what git is or it's potential, 
the tutor at the time explained it was not needed, therefore, I choose to not use git. 
Already the question "how is Git relevant" to my WEB class is at the forefront of my mind.

Turns out Git is highly relevant and is considered a portfolio for your c.v 
which can complement anyones career perspectives who are following the software and web development path and
 if you are working on a project it is a good idea to put it on git for not only the benefit for yourself and others but 
 also potential employers, to see what your interests are and what project you are working on in your spare time.

Ali proceeded to walk us through the course outline and downloading the appropriate tools of the trade. 
Introduces the class to a few git commands and explains we will no doubt be focusing on debugging during the semester.

Overall this class proved engaging and I look forward to the next class
