# Week 11 Session 19

Server Side Development 
Today I learnt that most websites use some kind of server side technology to dynamically render different data when required. For example in my BeeCourse's website if I wish to add a course to the wesite I can and if i need to adjust the cost or details of the course I can because i am rendering a static template usng HTML, CSS and JavaScript I can dynamically update the data displayed inside those templates when needed.

This day n age learning about the server-side developemnt is highly sort after and something i will look further into in the Summer break.

Test Driven Development 
Test might fail since tests are supposed to be developed before the developement. To beable to pass the test we need to develop and refactors the code therefore, changing some code without affecting its behaviour.
TDD needs further investigating but this is a job that is also sort after as many dont really like this job it might be a bit boring for some.
There are tools for automated testing out there that are widely implemented.

Testing routes 
Insomnia testing routes - i had a class collegue help me out here with routing which was a lot more complicated than I thought. Not so bad and reasonable easy once you know.

After this week I have thought ot remember what i have learned I will recreate my project from start on completion of this semester. 

I have a few freeCodeCamp tutorials to work through 
And a lot of Redux brain exploding to come
