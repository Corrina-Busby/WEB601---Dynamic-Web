# Week 11 Session 21

I have learned so much in this web paper and yet have barely scratched the surface. Fortunately, we have a mentor/lecturer who is passionate about passing on the wealth of knowledge he retains and maintains and has ensured all resources are still made available for us upon ending the semester as well as kept the networking side of developers alive with a MEETUP group formed during the semester with quite a few members in our group. 

On completion of this paper I am certain without a doubt I want to be a web developer thanks to Ali Kahwaji he has me hooked and I look forward to learning what I can, need, and want to fulfil my career in web development. 

I had not known what was so great about web development and just assumed if anyone wanted a website they can just leap on a cheapo Wordpress site, drag n drop data as they wish to advertise there products. Now, I can not get into the nitty gritty explaination and all the gory details at this time but it really doesnt take a genuius to know that developing websites is scalable and more personalised, over all better and better job wise. Theres no-way nike or addidas are using wordpress right? no. Upskilling in web developement is a must if you want to be snapped up hob wise and one day I may even hit the big contracts in the wide world of web developemnet and business.

Well sleep is calling and even though the website I have developed for this paper is now turned in I will continue to work on it. The goal for me this summer is to build a website portfolio to show future employers and I believe I will enjoy that more.
