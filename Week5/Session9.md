#  Week 5 Session 9

Today in class Ali the tutor took us through building an app from the ground up.
This came about with the student needs within the class - a good percentage in the class are struggling to glue together the 
learning to produce a website.

Ali also had us install "faker" giving us access to free online material we can implement into our own projects.

**Codecademy:** 
Still working through JavaScript tutorial 66% finished. Finding it very good only catch is is that tutorials take some time to work through. Currently spending 2 hours a day on tutorials and hoping something retains. 

**Routes:** 
Jase and I went through routes prior to class, we have our webpages linked to the appropiate pages just unsure whether Ali would like the routes done the way we have executed them.

During class Ali gave us link to take us through routing and it just so happens we were on the right track - yaay.

**Project:**
To date I am working on the navbar/css and learning about flex box which is a small challenge as much as my tutor Ali does not want ot hear the word bootstrap lol that is what I am more familiar with when it comes to building a navbar. 

Building comoponents to populate my websites pages is the next milestone and writing up the report which has become more than I had anticipated.
